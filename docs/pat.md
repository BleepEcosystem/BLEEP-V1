# 🧠 PAT: Programmable Asset Token

## 📘 Introduction
The **Programmable Asset Token (PAT)** is a core feature of the BLEEP blockchain that allows users to create, manage, and interact with customizable assets on-chain. PATs are deeply integrated with the BLEEP VM and BLP token economy, offering programmable rules, compliance controls, and advanced privacy.

## 🛠 Core Features
- **Custom Logic**: Embed asset-level rules directly into the token contract.
- **ZKP Transfers**: Leverages zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving operations.
- **Cross-Chain Operability**: PATs can interact with other networks through BLEEP Connect.
- **Compliance Layer**: Built-in auditability and programmable restrictions.
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Optional integration with AI to evaluate risk, behavior, or compliance.

## 🧩 Architecture
PATs operate as specialized smart contracts within the BLEEP VM. They extend the BLP token functionality with metadata and logic layers. Key architectural traits:
- Modular, composable contract patterns
- AES-GCM encrypted metadata fields
- Role-based access control
- Quantum-safe key infrastructure

> 📌 PATs inherit security features from BLEEP core modules: ZKP, quantum encryption, and dynamic governance.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy
- **ZKP-Based Authentication**
- **Quantum-Resistant Signatures**
- **Encrypted State Variables** (AES-GCM)
- **Programmable Access Controls**

## 💰 Economic Role
- All PAT operations consume BLP tokens as fuel.
- Token issuance, mutation, transfer, and destruction incur configurable fees.
- Supports integration into NFT, DeFi, and enterprise use cases.

## ⚙️ Code Example
```rust
// Core structure for a programmable asset
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct PAT {
    pub owner: AccountId,
    pub metadata: Vec<u8>,
    pub ruleset: Ruleset,
    pub encrypted_data: Vec<u8>,
}
```

## 📈 Use Cases
- **Tokenized real estate**
- **Enterprise compliance assets**
- **Dynamic NFTs**
- **Supply chain provenance**
- **Confidential tokenized shares**
