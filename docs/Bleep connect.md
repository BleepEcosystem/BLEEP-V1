## 🧬 Architecture Summary

### 🔌 Adapter Framework

Each blockchain integrates using the `Adapter` trait:

```rust
trait Adapter {
    fn adapt(&self, data: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>, BLEEPError>;
}
```

- Adapters are registered via `BLEEPInteroperabilityModule`  
- Cached using `TokioMutex<HashMap<Vec<u8>, Vec<u8>>>` for performance  
- Uses SHA256 (e.g. Ethereum, Cosmos), Blake2b (Polkadot), or signature verification (Solana)  

#### 🧠 Core Modules

- `AIAnomalyDetector`: Stops malicious activity before execution  
- `QuantumSecure`: Encrypts proofs and payloads post-ZKP  
- `BLEEPZKPModule`: zk-SNARK generation for secure computation  
- `LiquidityPool`: Manages cross-chain liquidity and conversion  
- `BLEEPNetworking`: Finalizes transactions via RPC interfaces

---

## 🔁 Workflow Overview

1. **Request Creation**  
   Structured as `CrossChainRequest` with sender, recipient, amount, signature, and metadata  

2. **Validation & Security**  
   - Signature verified  
   - AI analyzes features for anomalies  
   - zk-SNARK generated via `TransactionCircuit`  
   - Encrypted using `QuantumSecure`  

3. **Dispatch & Adaptation**  
   - Routed to appropriate adapter (e.g. `handle_filecoin_transfer()`)  
   - Data adapted and dispatched to blockchain endpoint  

4. **Confirmation & Response**  
   - Final transaction confirmed with target network  
   - `CrossChainResponse` returned with status and hash

## 📦 Developer Example

```rust
let test_data = b"Sample cross-chain transaction";
let adapted = interoperability_module.adapt("polkadot", test_data).await?;
println!("Adapted Data (Polkadot): {:?}", adapted);
```

---

## 🧠 SideChain Module

BLEEP supports multi-chain block validation using:

```rust
pub struct SideChainModule {
    pub sidechains: Arc<TokioMutex<HashMap<u64, Vec<Block>>>>,
}
```

Blocks contain:
- List of `Transaction`  
- Merkle root calculated via `calculate_merkle_root()`

---

## 🔍 Security Deep Dive

- `SolanaAdapter` performs full public key + signature verification  
- AI anomaly checks run asynchronously via `AIAnomalyDetector::detect_anomaly(&req)`  
- ZKP encryption uses `QuantumSecure::encrypt()`  
- Supported chains verified via internal dispatch and error enum `BLEEPConnectError`
